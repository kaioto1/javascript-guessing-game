# javascript-guessing-game
A simple number guessing game written in JavaScript.

## What my simple game can do
First of all, it shows the player if the number the user has entered into the field is too high or too low.Second of all, it shows all the turns the player has made. Thirdly, it shows the user a counter that counts the number of turns hethe player has made and last but not least, it shows the user an error message and a "Play again" button if the player could not guess the correct number in 10 turns.
